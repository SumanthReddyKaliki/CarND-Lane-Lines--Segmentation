    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

The parts that were left out and given as an excercise to experimenta were helpful in understanding diggerent concepts like canny, blur, and adjusting hough parameters etc. And I learned how to combine all this concepts and make them work together to solve interesting problems.\n",

Then I decided to split the problem into two ROIs(Region Of Interests) and then run hough twice, and do an additional slope filter pass. This yielded great results.\n",

I then use the maximum y and minimum y points as guide points for each line, using the slope and intercept from linear regression to extrapolate to the edge (or close to the edge) of the frame.\n"
